# Save the paragraph below — from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland — to a variable named text. Write two programs using “for” loops and/or list comprehensions to do the following:
#
# Create a single string that contains the second-to-last letter of each word in text, sorted alphabetically and in lowercase. Save it to a variable named letters and print. If a word is less than two letters in length, use the single character available.
# Find the average number of characters per word in text, rounded to the nearest hundredth. This value should exclude special characters, such as quotation marks and semicolons. Save it to a variable named avg_chars and print.
